# Images Directory

This directory is for storing all image assets for the "Beauty is in the Eyes of the Bipolar" blog.

## Placeholder Images
For development purposes, placeholder images should be put in this directory with the following naming convention:
- placeholder-1.jpg
- placeholder-2.jpg
- placeholder-3.jpg
- etc.

## Image Requirements
- Blog post featured images: 1200 x 800px
- Profile/about image: 800 x 800px
- Resource thumbnails: 600 x 400px

For the actual implementation, you should replace these placeholder images with real, properly licensed or owned images that relate to the content.
