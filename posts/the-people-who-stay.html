            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Mental illness can be a relationship filter. I'm learning to appreciate those who choose to understand rather than judge, who see me beyond my diagnosis. Here's my story of the people who've chosen to stay by my side.</p>

                <h2>The Initial Shock</h2>
                <p>When I first received my diagnosis, I was terrified of telling anyone. I worried about being judged, misunderstood, or worse—abandoned. Some relationships did change, but not always in the ways I expected.</p>

                <h2>Family: Learning Together</h2>
                <p>My family's response surprised me. While there was initial confusion and concern, they committed to learning about bipolar disorder. They asked questions, read articles, and even attended support group meetings. Their willingness to understand has made all the difference.</p>

                <h2>Friends: The Natural Selection</h2>
                <p>Some friends drifted away, and that's okay. But the ones who stayed? They've shown me what true friendship looks like. They've learned to recognize my patterns, offer support without judgment, and most importantly, they still treat me like me—not my diagnosis.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "True support isn't about fixing everything; it's about being there, listening, and accepting."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Building New Connections</h2>
                <p>Through support groups and online communities, I've met others who understand this journey firsthand. These connections have become invaluable—people who get it without explanation, who share their own strategies and stories.</p>

                <h2>Professional Relationships</h2>
                <p>My healthcare team has become an essential part of my support system. From my psychiatrist to my therapist, these professionals have helped me navigate not just my symptoms, but also my relationships with others.</p>

                <p>The people who stay are the ones who understand that bipolar disorder is part of me, but not all of me. They celebrate my good days, support me through the hard ones, and remind me that I'm worthy of love and understanding, regardless of my mental health status.</p>
